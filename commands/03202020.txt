## Step1 :created develop branch
git checkout -b develop

this is a shortcut for 
git branch develop
git checkout develop

## Step 2: Created a fie in the develop branch, added it and then committed it

## Step 3: i switch the branch to master and did a merge with master and later commit and push

$ git merge develop
Updating 0480fd5..c735620

 create mode 100644 developBranchFile1.txt


while i was pushing the changes i made, i got a message stating that 

$ git push
fatal: The current branch develop has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin develop

pretty new to me so i just did what it recommended

$ git push --set-upstream origin develop
